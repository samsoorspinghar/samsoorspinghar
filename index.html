            resources, in addition to a number of people - related administrative activates. 
            Management of Design and Construction Process: 
            In the planning of facilities, SSCC sees it very important to recognize the Close relationship between design and 
            construction, these processes can best be viewed as an integrated system broadly speaking, design is a 
            process of creating the description of a new facility, usually represented by detailed plans and specification; 
            construction planning is a process of identifying activities and resources required to make the design a 
            physical reality. Hence, construction is the implementation of a design envisioned by architects and 
            engineer. 
            Operational tasks are to be performed with a variety of precedence and other relationships among the different 
            tasks.
            SSCC recognized that there are several unique characteristics to the planning of construction 
            facilities and we will keep them in mind even at the very early stage of the project life cycle. These 
            include the following:
            .Nearly every facility is custom designed and constructed, it often requires a long time to complete. 
            .Both the design and construction of a facility must satisfy the conditions peculiar to a specific site. 
            .Because each project is site specific. Its execution is in influenced by natural, social and other 
            location conditions such as weather, labor supply, government standards, etc
            . Because of technological complexity and market demands, of design plans during construction are.</p>
